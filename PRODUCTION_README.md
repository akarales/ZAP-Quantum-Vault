# Zap Vault - Production Ready Application

## Overview

This is a production-ready quantum-secure USB drive management application built with Tauri, React, and Rust. The application provides advanced encryption, backup management, and secure vault operations without any mock data or development fallbacks.

## Production Features

### ✅ Core Functionality
- **Real Tauri Backend**: All API calls use actual Tauri commands registered in the Rust backend
- **No Mock Data**: Removed all mock handlers and development fallbacks
- **Production Error Handling**: Proper error messages when Tauri environment is not available
- **USB Drive Management**: Full LUKS encryption, formatting, and drive operations
- **Backup System**: Complete backup creation and management with encryption options
- **Vault Operations**: Secure password and data storage with offline capabilities

### ✅ UI/UX Improvements
- **Inline Trust Management**: Direct Trust/Untrust buttons instead of popup dialogs
- **Current Password Display**: Shows existing passwords for encrypted drives with show/hide toggle
- **Correct Button Logic**: 
  - Unencrypted drives: "Format & Encrypt Drive" button
  - Encrypted drives: "Format & Re-encrypt" button
- **No Popup Dialogs**: All functionality integrated into main page interface
- **Advanced Password Generator**: Integrated quantum-resistant password generation

### ✅ Architecture
- **SOLID Principles**: Component decomposition following single responsibility
- **Custom Hooks**: Separated business logic into focused hooks
- **Service Layer**: Clean separation between UI and Tauri API calls
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery

## Build and Run

### Production Build
```bash
./build-production.sh
```

### Development Mode (Tauri Required)
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

### Frontend Only (Will Show Tauri Required Error)
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Tauri Commands Used

### USB Drive Operations
- `detect_usb_drives` - Detect connected USB drives
- `get_drive_details` - Get detailed drive information
- `format_and_encrypt_drive` - Format and encrypt drives with LUKS
- `mount_drive` - Mount drives
- `unmount_drive` - Unmount drives
- `mount_encrypted_drive` - Mount encrypted drives with password
- `set_drive_trust` - Set trust level for drives

### Backup Operations
- `create_backup` - Create encrypted backups
- `list_backups` - List existing backups

### Password Management
- `get_usb_drive_password` - Retrieve stored passwords
- `save_usb_drive_password` - Save drive passwords securely

### Vault Operations
- `get_user_vaults_offline` - Get user vaults
- `create_vault_offline` - Create new vaults
- `get_vault_items_offline` - Get vault items
- `create_vault_item_offline` - Create vault items

### Bitcoin Key Management
- `list_bitcoin_keys` - List Bitcoin keys
- `generate_bitcoin_key` - Generate new Bitcoin keys

## Security Features

### Encryption
- **LUKS2 Encryption**: Industry-standard disk encryption
- **Quantum-Resistant Options**: Future-proof encryption methods
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Passwords never stored in plaintext

### Trust Management
- **Drive Trust Levels**: Untrusted, Partial, Full trust levels
- **Inline Controls**: Direct trust management without popups
- **Security Warnings**: Clear indicators for trust status

### Password Security
- **Advanced Generation**: Quantum-resistant password generation
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted password storage in vault
- **Verification**: Password verification before operations

## Error Handling

The application provides clear error messages for common scenarios:

- **Tauri Not Available**: "This application requires Tauri environment. Please run in desktop mode."
- **Drive Not Found**: Proper error display with navigation back to drives list
- **Operation Failures**: Detailed error messages for failed operations
- **Password Validation**: Real-time password strength feedback

## Development Notes

### Removed Features
- ❌ All mock API handlers
- ❌ Browser environment fallbacks
- ❌ Development-only code paths
- ❌ Popup dialogs and modals
- ❌ Mock data generators

### Production Requirements
- ✅ Tauri desktop environment required
- ✅ Rust backend with registered commands
- ✅ SQLite database for vault operations
- ✅ System-level USB drive access
- ✅ LUKS encryption tools

## Testing

To verify production readiness:

1. **Build Application**: Run `./build-production.sh`
2. **Test Desktop Mode**: Launch the built executable
3. **Verify USB Operations**: Connect USB drives and test formatting
4. **Test Vault Operations**: Create vaults and manage items
5. **Verify Error Handling**: Test without Tauri environment

## Deployment

The application is ready for deployment as a desktop application. The build script creates:

- **Linux**: AppImage and DEB packages
- **Windows**: MSI installer (when built on Windows)
- **macOS**: DMG installer (when built on macOS)

## Support

This is a production-ready application with no development dependencies or mock data. All functionality requires the Tauri desktop environment with proper system permissions for USB drive management.
