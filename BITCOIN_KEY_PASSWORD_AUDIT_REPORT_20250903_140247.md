- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Bitcoin key inventory cards display encryption passwords with copy functionality
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Backup process successfully decrypts all keys using stored passwords
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Password validation errors in backup process eliminated
- ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Eye icon toggle for password visibility on UI cards

## Detailed Audit Results

### 1. Database Storage Verification

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED WORKING

**Database Schema:**
```sql
-- bitcoin_keys table includes encryption_password field
CREATE TABLE bitcoin_keys (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    vault_id TEXT,
    key_type TEXT,
    network TEXT,
    encrypted_private_key BLOB,
    public_key BLOB,
    derivation_path TEXT,
    entropy_source TEXT,
    quantum_enhanced BOOLEAN,
    created_at TEXT,
    last_used TEXT,
    is_active BOOLEAN,
    encryption_password TEXT  -- ✅ CONFIRMED PRESENT
);
```

**Verification Results:**
- Encryption passwords are correctly stored during Bitcoin key creation
- Database INSERT operation includes `encryption_password` field (line 142 in `bitcoin_commands.rs`)
- Storage mechanism functioning as designed

### 2. Password Retrieval and Display

**Status:** ✅ FIXED AND VERIFIED

**Issues Identified:**
- Bitcoin key retrieval query was missing `encryption_password` field
- UI cards showed empty password fields despite database storage

**Resolution Applied:**
```rust
// BEFORE (missing encryption_password)
SELECT bk.id, bk.vault_id, bk.key_type, bk.network, bk.encrypted_private_key, 
       bk.public_key, bk.derivation_path, bk.entropy_source, bk.quantum_enhanced, 
       bk.created_at, bk.last_used, bk.is_active, bkm.label, bkm.description, 
       bkm.tags, bkm.balance_satoshis, bkm.transaction_count, ra.address

// AFTER (includes encryption_password)
SELECT bk.id, bk.vault_id, bk.key_type, bk.network, bk.encrypted_private_key, 
       bk.public_key, bk.derivation_path, bk.entropy_source, bk.quantum_enhanced, 
       bk.created_at, bk.last_used, bk.is_active, bk.encryption_password, 
       bkm.label, bkm.description, bkm.tags, bkm.balance_satoshis, 
       bkm.transaction_count, ra.address
```

**UI Enhancement:**
- Added eye icon toggle for password visibility
- Passwords hidden by default with bullet characters
- Copy functionality maintained
- TypeScript interface updated to include `encryptionPassword?: string`

### 3. Backup Process Analysis

**Status:** ✅ FIXED AND VERIFIED

**Critical Issue Identified:**
The backup process was failing with "Invalid password: Weak password" errors due to strict password validation being applied to stored encryption passwords.

**Root Cause:**
```rust
// PROBLEMATIC CODE
let secure_password = SecurePassword::new(backup_password)
    .map_err(|e| format!("Invalid password: {}", e))?;
```

The `SecurePassword::new()` method enforces strict complexity requirements:
- Minimum 8 characters
- Must contain uppercase letters
- Must contain lowercase letters  
- Must contain digits
- Must contain special characters

**Resolution Applied:**
```rust
// NEW SOLUTION
impl SecurePassword {
    // Existing validation method for new passwords
    pub fn new(password: String) -> Result<Self, EncryptionError> { ... }
    
    // NEW: Bypass validation for stored passwords
    pub fn from_stored(password: String) -> Self {
        Self(Secret::new(password))
    }
}

// Updated backup command
let secure_password = SecurePassword::from_stored(backup_password);
```

### 4. Backup Verification Results

**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS

**Backup Contents Verified:**

#### Bitcoin Keys Successfully Decrypted:
1. **Key 1 (bb85df7a-19fb-4430-aad0-7b457be9d169)**
   - Password: `Bf6,N%UmdmT%IZN2(+soPt)0F|mISr8D`
   - Status: ✅ Successfully decrypted
   - Private Key: `4f3d3467069c8a53133031ccc5382ffce5eb45511a13d6a25d713505b3cc9053`

```

### 5. Security Analysis

**Password Storage Security:**
- Encryption passwords stored in database as plaintext (by design for backup functionality)
- USB drive encryption provides primary security layer for backup files
- Private keys decrypted during backup creation using stored passwords
- Backup files contain plaintext private keys (secured by USB encryption)

**Security Model Verification:**
- ✅ Database stores encryption passwords for seamless backup
- ✅ USB drive LUKS encryption protects backup files
- ✅ No hardcoded passwords or fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Password validation bypassed only for stored passwords, not new ones

## Technical Implementation Details

### Code Changes Applied

#### 1. Backend Changes (`src-tauri/src/`)

**File:** `bitcoin_commands.rs`
- Added `bk.encryption_password` to SQL SELECT query (line 258)
- Added `"encryptionPassword": row.get::<Option<String>, _>("encryption_password")` to JSON response (line 289)

**File:** `encryption.rs`
- Added `SecurePassword::from_stored()` method for bypassing validation on stored passwords
- Maintains security for new password creation while allowing stored password usage

**File:** `cold_storage_commands.rs`
- Updated backup process to use `SecurePassword::from_stored()` instead of `SecurePassword::new()`
- Eliminated password validation errors during backup creation

#### 2. Frontend Changes (`src/`)
