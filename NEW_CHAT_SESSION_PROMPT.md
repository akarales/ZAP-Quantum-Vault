# ZAP Quantum Vault - Database Key Loading Issue Investigation

## Context
I'm working on the ZAP Quantum Vault project and have discovered critical issues with Bitcoin and Ethereum key loading. The dashboard shows 0 keys for these types despite the user claiming they exist in the database. ZAP blockchain keys (63) and Cosmos keys (1) are working correctly.

## Current Project State
- **Location**: `/home/anubix/CODE/zapchat_project/zap_vault`
- **Application**: Tauri-based desktop app with React frontend and Rust backend
- **Database**: SQLite at `/home/anubix/.local/share/com.zap-vault/vault.db`
- **Issue**: Bitcoin and Ethereum keys showing 0 count despite allegedly existing in database

## What I've Already Fixed
✅ **Parameter Consistency Issues**: Fixed `vaultId` → `vault_id` in:
- `VaultDetailsPage.tsx` (Ethereum and Cosmos key loading)
- `DashboardPage.tsx` (ZAP blockchain keys)  
- `EthereumKeysPage.tsx` (parameter naming)

✅ **Vault Resolution**: Confirmed `default_vault` resolves to `57e132d4-feac-4a69-ab10-022b0f7da471`

✅ **Working Components**: ZAP blockchain keys (63) and Cosmos keys (1) load correctly

## Critical Issues Discovered

### 1. Database Connectivity Problems
- SQLite commands return empty output when querying the database directly
- Cannot verify table structure or key existence
- Potential file permissions or database corruption

### 2. Backend Log Analysis
- Bitcoin commands show vault resolution but return 0 results
- No Ethereum command execution visible in backend logs
- ZAP blockchain commands process 63 keys successfully

### 3. Frontend-Backend Synchronization
- Parameter fixes applied but Bitcoin/Ethereum still showing 0
- Detailed logging shows functions being called but no results

## Immediate Tasks Needed

### 1. Database Investigation (HIGH PRIORITY)
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /home/anubix/CODE/zapchat_project/zap_vault

# Start application to ensure database is active
pnpm run tauri dev

# In separate terminal, investigate database
sqlite3 /home/anubix/.local/share/com.zap-vault/vault.db ".tables"
sqlite3 /home/anubix/.local/share/com.zap-vault/vault.db ".schema"
sqlite3 /home/anubix/.local/share/com.zap-vault/vault.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bitcoin_keys WHERE is_active = 1;"
sqlite3 /home/anubix/.local/share/com.zap-vault/vault.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ethereum_keys WHERE is_active = 1;"
```

### 2. Code Audit Required
**Backend Files to Review**:
- `src-tauri/src/bitcoin_commands.rs` - Check `list_bitcoin_keys` SQL query
- `src-tauri/src/ethereum_commands.rs` - Check `list_ethereum_keys` SQL query
- `src-tauri/src/database.rs` - Verify database initialization and migrations

**Frontend Files to Review**:
- `src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` - Key loading functions (lines 50-220)
- `src/pages/VaultDetailsPage.tsx` - Key display logic
- `src/utils/tauri-api.ts` - Tauri command wrapper

### 3. Debugging Steps
1. **Monitor Backend Logs**: Watch for Bitcoin/Ethereum command execution
2. **Check Browser Console**: Look for JavaScript errors during key loading
3. **Verify SQL Queries**: Ensure WHERE clauses and JOIN conditions are correct
4. **Test Key Creation**: Try generating new Bitcoin/Ethereum keys to verify functionality

## Key Questions to Answer
1. Do Bitcoin and Ethereum keys actually exist in the database?
2. Are the SQL queries in backend commands correctly formatted?
3. Is there a database schema migration issue?
4. Are there file permission problems with the database?
5. Is the vault ID resolution working consistently across all key types?

## Expected Behavior
- Dashboard should show accurate counts for all key types
- Vault details page should display all keys for the resolved vault UUID
- Backend logs should show successful key retrieval for all blockchain types

## Files Already Modified
- `/home/anubix/CODE/zapchat_project/zap_vault/src/pages/VaultDetailsPage.tsx`
- `/home/anubix/CODE/zapchat_project/zap_vault/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`
- `/home/anubix/CODE/zapchat_project/zap_vault/src/pages/EthereumKeysPage.tsx`

## Analysis Document
Created comprehensive analysis: `/home/anubix/CODE/zapchat_project/zap_vault/DATABASE_KEY_LOADING_ISSUE_ANALYSIS.md`

## Instructions for New Session
1. Start by running the application: `pnpm run tauri dev`
2. Investigate database connectivity and table structure
3. Review backend SQL queries for Bitcoin and Ethereum commands
4. Monitor backend logs during key loading attempts
5. Perform systematic code audit of key loading pipeline
6. Test key creation functionality to verify database write operations

## Success Criteria
- Bitcoin and Ethereum keys display correct counts on dashboard
- All key types load properly in vault details page  
- Backend logs show successful query execution for all blockchain types
- Database queries return expected results when run directly

**Priority**: Critical - Core application functionality impacted
**Status**: Investigation phase - Database connectivity issues blocking progress
**Next Action**: Database investigation and backend code audit required
