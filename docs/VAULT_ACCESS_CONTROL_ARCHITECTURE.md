# Vault Access Control Architecture - SOLID Principles Implementation

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This document outlines the SOLID principles-based solution for vault access control in the Zap Quantum Vault system.

## 🎯 Design Goals

1. **Admin users see all vaults** - Root/admin users have full visibility
2. **Role-based access control** - Different permissions based on user roles
3. **Extensible permissions** - Easy to add new access patterns
4. **Secure by default** - Explicit permission checks
5. **SOLID compliance** - Clean, maintainable architecture

## 📋 SOLID Principles Implementation

### **S - Single Responsibility Principle**
- `VaultRepository` - Only handles data access
- `VaultService` - Only handles business logic
- `AccessPolicy` - Only handles permission logic
- `UserContextFactory` - Only handles user creation

### **O - Open/Closed Principle**
- New access policies can be added without modifying existing code
- `CompositeAccessPolicy` allows combining multiple policies
- Extensible permission system

### **L - Liskov Substitution Principle**
- All access policies implement the same interface
- Policies can be swapped without breaking functionality
- Repository implementations are interchangeable

### **I - Interface Segregation Principle**
- `VaultAccessPolicy` - For permission checks
- `VaultQueryPolicy` - For vault filtering
- `VaultRepository` - For data access
- Clients only depend on interfaces they use

### **D - Dependency Inversion Principle**
- High-level modules depend on abstractions
- Concrete implementations are injected
- Easy to test and mock dependencies

## 🔐 Access Control Matrix

| User Role | Own Vaults | Shared Vaults | All Vaults | System Vaults |
|-----------|------------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| **Admin** | ✅ Full    | ✅ Full       | ✅ Full    | ✅ Full       |
| **User**  | ✅ Full    | ✅ Read       | ❌ None    | ❌ None       |
| **Guest** | ❌ None    | ✅ Read       | ❌ None    | ❌ None       |

## 🚀 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Create access control interfaces
- [x] Implement basic policies (Admin, Owner)
- [x] Create vault service with dependency injection
- [x] Add user context factory

### Phase 2: Integration
- [ ] Update existing vault commands to use new service
- [ ] Add JWT token validation
- [ ] Implement proper user role detection
- [ ] Add permission-based UI controls

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Vault sharing permissions
- [ ] Audit logging for access control
- [ ] Time-based access controls
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Admin User Access
```rust
// Admin sees all vaults
let admin_user = User { role: "admin", ... };
let vaults = vault_service.get_user_accessible_vaults(&admin_user).await?;
// Returns ALL vaults in the system
```

### Regular User Access
```rust
// Regular user sees own + shared vaults
let user = User { role: "user", id: "user123", ... };
let vaults = vault_service.get_user_accessible_vaults(&user).await?;
// Returns only vaults owned by user123 + shared vaults
```

### Permission Checks
```rust
// Check if user can delete a vault
let can_delete = vault_service.can_user_perform_action(
    &user, 
    "vault_id", 
    VaultPermission::Delete
).await?;
```

## 🔄 Migration Strategy

### Current State
- Hardcoded `DEFAULT_USER_ID` constant
- No role-based access control
- Mixed offline/online modes

### Target State
- Dynamic user context based on authentication
- Role-based vault visibility
- Consistent access control across all operations

### Migration Steps
1. **Parallel Implementation** - New commands alongside existing ones
2. **Gradual Migration** - Update frontend to use new commands
3. **Deprecation** - Remove old hardcoded approaches
4. **Cleanup** - Remove unused code and constants

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test each access policy independently
- Mock repository for service tests
- Verify permission combinations

### Integration Tests
- Test complete vault access flows
- Verify admin can see all vaults
- Ensure users can't access unauthorized vaults

### Security Tests
- Attempt unauthorized access
- Test privilege escalation scenarios
- Verify audit logging

## 📊 Benefits

### For Administrators
- **Full Visibility** - See all vaults across the system
- **Centralized Management** - Manage all user vaults
- **Audit Capabilities** - Track vault access and modifications

### For Users
- **Privacy** - Own vaults remain private by default
- **Sharing** - Controlled sharing with other users
- **Security** - Explicit permission checks

### For Developers
- **Maintainability** - Clean separation of concerns
- **Extensibility** - Easy to add new features
- **Testability** - Mockable dependencies
- **Reliability** - Explicit error handling

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

1. **Granular Permissions** - Item-level access control
2. **Temporary Access** - Time-limited vault sharing
3. **Group Permissions** - Role-based team access
4. **External Integration** - LDAP/OAuth role mapping
5. **Compliance Features** - GDPR, SOX audit trails

## 🏁 Conclusion

This SOLID-based architecture provides:
- **Secure** vault access control
- **Flexible** permission system
- **Maintainable** codebase
- **Scalable** for future requirements

The implementation ensures admin users can see all vaults while maintaining security for regular users.
