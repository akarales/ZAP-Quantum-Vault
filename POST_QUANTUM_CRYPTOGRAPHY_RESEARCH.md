# Post-Quantum Cryptography for ZAP Quantum Vault Cold Storage

## Executive Summary

VeraCrypt's current encryption (AES-256) is **NOT quantum-resistant**. A sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Grover's algorithm could reduce AES-256's effective security from 256 bits to 128 bits, and Shor's algorithm could completely break RSA/ECC key exchange mechanisms. For the ZAP Quantum Vault, we need to implement post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to ensure long-term security against quantum threats.

## Current VeraCrypt Security Analysis

### What VeraCrypt Uses (Classical Cryptography)
- **Symmetric Encryption**: AES-256, Serpent, Twofish
