# ZAP Quantum Vault Cold Storage Research & Implementation Guide

## Cross-Platform Encryption Standards Analysis

### Option 1: VeraCrypt (Recommended for Cross-Platform)
**Pros:**
- Full cross-platform support (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- Strong AES-256 encryption with multiple cipher options
- Hidden volumes and plausible deniability features
- Portable mode available for emergency access
- Well-established and audited codebase
- Can create encrypted containers or full disk encryption

**Cons:**
- Requires VeraCrypt software installation on target systems
- Slightly more complex setup process
- Performance overhead during encryption/decryption

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Create encrypted container
veracrypt --create /dev/sdb1 --volume-type=normal --encryption=AES --hash=SHA-512 --filesystem=FAT32 --password="user_password"

# Mount encrypted volume
veracrypt --mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/vault --password="user_password"
```

### Option 2: LUKS (Linux Native)
**Pros:**
- Native Linux kernel support
- Excellent performance
- Strong cryptographic implementation
- Standard for Linux disk encryption

**Cons:**
- Limited cross-platform support
- Requires third-party tools on Windows/macOS
- More complex for non-Linux users

### Option 3: BitLocker to Go (Windows Native)
**Pros:**
- Native Windows support
- Good integration with Windows systems

**Cons:**
- Windows-only solution
- Limited Linux/macOS compatibility
- Requires Windows Pro/Enterprise

## Recommended Solution: VeraCrypt with FAT32

For maximum cross-platform compatibility, we recommend:

1. **Encryption**: VeraCrypt with AES-256-XTS
2. **Filesystem**: FAT32 (universal compatibility)
3. **Container Type**: Standard volume (not hidden)
4. **Hash Algorithm**: SHA-512
5. **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with high iteration count

## Implementation Architecture

### Drive Preparation Workflow

1. **Trust Verification**: User must mark drive as "Trusted"
2. **Data Backup Warning**: Warn user about data loss
3. **Encryption Setup**: Configure VeraCrypt parameters
4. **Format Process**: Create encrypted container
5. **Verification**: Test mount/unmount cycle
6. **Backup Structure**: Create standardized folder structure

### Backup Structure

## Cross-Platform Access Instructions

### Linux Access
```bash
# Install VeraCrypt
sudo apt install veracrypt

# Mount drive
veracrypt /dev/sdb1 /mnt/vault

# Access backup
cd /mnt/vault/ZAPCHAT_VAULT_BACKUP
```

### Windows Access
```powershell
# Download and install VeraCrypt from veracrypt.fr
# Use VeraCrypt GUI to mount drive
# Navigate to mounted drive letter
```

### macOS Access
```bash
# Install VeraCrypt from veracrypt.fr
# Use VeraCrypt GUI or command line
sudo veracrypt /dev/disk2 /Volumes/vault
```

## Security Considerations

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 20 characters
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- Not based on dictionary words
- Unique to this backup system

### Recovery Options
1. **Primary**: User password
2. **Secondary**: BIP39 recovery phrase (24 words)
3. **Emergency**: Master key file (encrypted separately)

### Threat Model
- **Physical theft**: Drive encryption protects data
- **Password compromise**: Recovery phrase provides alternative access
- **Software failure**: Cross-platform tools ensure accessibility
- **Vendor lock-in**: Open standards prevent dependency

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Formatting
1. Implement VeraCrypt integration
2. Create drive formatting workflow
3. Add password validation
4. Implement basic backup structure

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. Recovery phrase generation and storage
2. Backup verification and integrity checks
3. Incremental backup support
4. Cross-platform recovery tools

### Phase 3: Enterprise Features
1. Multi-signature recovery
2. Hardware security module integration
3. Audit logging
4. Compliance reporting

## Usage Workflow

### Initial Setup
1. Insert USB drive into system
2. Navigate to Cold Storage page
3. Select drive and click "Trust Drive"
4. Choose "Format & Encrypt Drive"
5. Set strong password and confirm
6. Wait for formatting completion
7. Verify drive can be mounted/unmounted

### Creating Backups
1. Select trusted, encrypted drive
2. Choose backup type (Full/Incremental/Selective)
3. Select vaults to backup
4. Enter drive password
5. Monitor backup progress
6. Verify backup integrity

### Restoring from Backup
1. Insert backup drive
2. Mount encrypted volume
3. Navigate to backup location

2. Use recovery phrase to regenerate master key
3. Decrypt master key file
4. Use master key to access drive

### If Drive is Corrupted
